# Dell-Management-Content-auto-RegEdit
DMC (Dell Management Console) auto RegEdit is a small .bat file to automatically modify and add your correct pc model (DELL_G, DELL_XPS, DELL_INSPIRON, DELL_ALIENWARE, DELL_VOSTRO, ...) in your Windows Registry.

In particular, it solves the problem of downloading the My Dell application from the Windows Store (provided that your computer meets the necessary model requirements).

All you need to do after using it is to restart the PC.
